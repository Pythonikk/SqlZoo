# SQL Zoo

An assignment given by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/databases-sql-zoo) to become comfortable writing queries using SQL. This project is a collection of my solutions to the tutorials on [sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), a resource for building and running queries against existing tables.
